# Hackathon-Worksite Safety Monitoring

Ensuring a worksite safety thanks to computer vision technology


The client, a player in the construction industry is building a worksite monitoring solution to evaluate and mitigate risks on worksites

• Build a worker detection model based on annotated data

• Cluster the images to process each camera independently (prerequisite to draw heatmaps)

• Build a heatmap for each worksites with density of workers during the day

• Expose your result and performance on a dashboard with a test dataset

• Identify additional value that could be brought by the detection mode
